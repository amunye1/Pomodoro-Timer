# React + Vite

This project is something similar to a Pomodoro Timer with some sort of Endel feature where you hear sounds to focus while you work on your tasks. We are using React JS, Vanilla JS . We are using Flask and PostgreSQL for the back end and hosting with AWS EC@ and for our CI/CD automation we are using Jenkins.
